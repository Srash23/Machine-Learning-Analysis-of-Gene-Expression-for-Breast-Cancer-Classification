Breast cancer, a significant global health issue, necessitates advanced diagnostic approaches. This study integrates oncology with machine learning, utilizing logistic regression to analyze large-scale gene expression data. Our objective is to identify key genes that distinguish between 'normal' and 'adeno_carcinoma' breast cancer classes. By examining the expression levels of approximately 35,982 genes, we uncover critical patterns and relationships that aid in early detection and personalized treatment. The analysis reveals influential genes, such as ENST00000426370 and ENST00000358739, which serve as potential biomarkers for breast cancer classification. This research contributes to the development of targeted therapies and enhances our understanding of breast cancer genetics.
